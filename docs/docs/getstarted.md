# Introduction

UI Labs is a Storybook plugin for Roblox.

When you work with **Declarative UI Libraries** like **[Roact](https://roblox.github.io/roact/)** or **[Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/0.2/)**, creating User Interfaces with code becomes challenging when you try to preview them. UI Labs aims to solve this problem:

---

-   Allows you to preview your UI code instantly without running your game.

-   Features a Hot-Reloader that updates your changes in real-time.

-   Provides a **Sandboxed environment** for your code to run in, you dont have to worry about reverting all your changes.
