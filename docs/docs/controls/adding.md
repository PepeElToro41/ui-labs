# Adding Controls


UI Labs let's you add Controls. They are configurable values that you can modify while visualizing your interface.<br/>
This is useful for testing different values for your UI without needing to modify your code.

You can use [Flipbook's Controls](https://flipbook-labs.github.io/flipbook/docs/writing-stories#controls) with UI Labs, but UI Labs allows for more customization and advanced controls.

## Configuring Controls

You can add your controls list in the <span class="item-description">controls</span> key of your story table.<br />

We'll learn how to use controls later, first let's see how you can create them.

The controls table, is a list of values where the key is the name of the control and the value is the control declaration.

```lua [Luau] {2-4,8}
local controls = {
   control1 = ...,
   control2 = ...,
   control3 = ...,
}

local story = {
   controls = controls,
   story = ...
}
```

```ts [Roblox-TS] {2-4,8}
const controls = {
   control1: ...,
   control2: ...,
   control3: ...,
}

const story = {
   controls: controls,
   story: ...
}
```

We can create two types of controls:

- [Primitive Controls](/docs/controls/primitive)
- [Advanced Controls](/docs/controls/advanced)
